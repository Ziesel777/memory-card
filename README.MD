# Webpack project template for Phaser 3 & Phaser Editor 2D

A project template for Phaser 3, Webpack 5, and Phaser Editor 2D v3.

## First steps

This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [NPM.js](https://www.npmjs.com). It is recommended that you learn the basics of [Webpack.js](https://www/webpack.js.org).

* Install dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

* Run the development server:

    ```
    npm start
    ```

    Open the browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

* Make a production build:

    ```
    npm build
    ```

    It is generated in the `/dist` folder.

## Phaser Editor 2D considerations

### Excluding files from the project

There are a lot of files present in the project that are not relevant to Phaser Editor 2D. For example, the whole `node_modules` folder should be excluded from the editor's project.

The `/.skip` file lists the folders and files to exclude from the editor's project.

### Setting the root folder for the game's assets

The `/static` folder contains the assets (images, audio, atlases) used by the game. Webpack copies it to the distribution folder and makes it available as a root path. For example, `http://127.0.0.1:8080/assets` points to the `/static/assets` folder.

By default, Phaser Editor 2D uses the project's root as the start path for the assets. You can change it by creating an empty `publicroot` file. That is the case of the `/static/publicroot` file, which allows adding files to the Asset Pack file (`/static/assets/asset-pack.json`) using correct URLs.

### Coding

The `/src` folder contains all the JavaScript code, including the scene and user component files, in addition to the Phaser Editor 2D compilers output.

We recommend using Visual Studio Code for editing the code files.

In many tutorials about Phaser Editor 2D, the JavaScript files are loaded using the Asset Pack editor. When using Webpack this is not needed. Just use the Asset Pack editor for loading the art assets.

### Scene and User Components configuration

The Scenes and User Components are configured to compile to JavaScript ES modules. Also, the compilers auto-import the classes used in the generated code.
